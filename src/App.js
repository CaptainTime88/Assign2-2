        I'm hearing from evangelicals who may not agree with progressives on every issue but agree that poverty has no place in a world of plenty; that hate has no place in the hearts of believers; and that we all have to be good stewards of God's creations. But what my former pastor too often failed to understand is that embarking on a program of self-help also requires a belief that society can change. It is easier to blame others than to look inward; to see what is different about someone than to find the things we share.

It's time for us to change America. At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future. Instead, they overlap, and share common principles - principles of justice and progress; tolerance and the dignity of all human beings. Too much blood has been shed.

Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill. I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination. The United States has been one of the greatest sources of progress that the world has ever known.
